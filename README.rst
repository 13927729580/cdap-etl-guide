Creating ETL Pipelines using CDAP ETL Application Templates
===========================================================

Using CDAP ETL Application Templates, you can create ETL Pipelines (ETL Adapters) with just a JSON configuration file. 
CDAP ships with a set of built-in Sources, Sinks and Transforms [http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/application-templates/index.html] 
which can be used to create Batch ETL and Realtime ETL Adapters right out of the box.

Note: If you want to create your own Source and Sink, you can find more instructions on how to do that here : 
[http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/application-templates/etl/custom.html]

What You Will Create
====================

[Realtime Twitter To HBase](/RealtimeTwitterToHBase/)
---------------------------

In this Adapter, we will read Tweets from Twitter in Realtime and write to HBase Table.


[Realtime Kafka To HBase](/RealtimeKafkaToHBase/)
-------------------------

In this Adapter, we will fetch messages from Kafka in Realtime and write to HBase Table.


[Batch CDAP Stream To Impala](/StreamToImpala/)
-----------------------------

In this Adapter, we will make the events ingested in a CDAP Stream queryable through Impala.


[RDBMS To HBase](/DBTableToHBaseTable/)
----------------

In this Adapter, we will read data from a RDBMS Table and write to HBase Table.


[HBase to RDMBS](/HBaseTableToDBTable/)
----------------

In this Adapter, we will read data from a HBase Table and write to a RDBMS Table.

What You Will Need
==================

- `JDK 7 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__
- `CDAP SDK <http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/getting-started/standalone/index.html>`__

Let's Begin!
============

For these guides, we will use the CDAP CLI to create and manage Adapters. The CLI commands assume that the ``cdap-cli.sh`` script is available on your PATH. 
If this is not the case, please add it::

  $ export PATH=$PATH:<CDAP home>/bin

If you haven't already started a standalone CDAP installation, start it with the command::

  $ cdap.sh start

Now navigate to the Adapter that you want to create and you will find further instructions on how to create that specific Adapter.

Share and Discuss!
