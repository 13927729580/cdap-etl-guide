Creating Hydrator Applications using CDAP System Artifacts
==========================================================

Using the built-in ``cdap-data-pipeline`` and ``cdap-data-streams`` system artifacts, you can
create Cask Hydrator Pipelines (Hydrator Applications) with just a JSON configuration file. CDAP ships
with a set of built-in Sources, Sinks, Transforms, and other plugins (described `here
<http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/hydrator-manual/plugins/index.html>`__) which can be used
to create batch and real-time data pipeline applications right out of the box.

Note: If you want to create your own Source, Sink, or other plugin, you can find more
instructions on how to do that `here
<http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/hydrator-manual/developing-plugins/index.html>`__.

**Note:** Both the ``cdap-etl-batch`` and ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifacts have been
deprecated as of CDAP 3.5.0 and replaced with the artifacts ``cdap-data-pipeline`` and
``cdap-data-streams`` respectively.


What You Will Create
====================

.. |CDAPTableToDBTable| replace:: **Batch CDAP HBase Table to Database Table:**
.. _CDAPTableToDBTable: CDAPTableToDBTable

- |CDAPTableToDBTable|_ This application exports the contents of a CDAP HBase Table to a Database Table in Batch.


.. |DBTableToCDAPTable| replace:: **Batch Database Table to CDAP HBase Table:**
.. _DBTableToCDAPTable: DBTableToCDAPTable

- |DBTableToCDAPTable|_ This application exports the contents of a Database Table to a CDAP HBase table in Batch.


.. |StreamToImpala| replace:: **Batch CDAP Stream to Impala:**
.. _StreamToImpala: StreamToImpala

- |StreamToImpala|_ This application makes the events ingested in a CDAP Stream queryable through Impala.


.. |RealtimeJMSToStream| replace:: **Real-time JMS to Stream:**
.. _RealtimeJMSToStream: RealtimeJMSToStream

- |RealtimeJMSToStream|_ This application reads messages from a JMS producer in real time and writes to a CDAP Stream.


.. |RealtimeKafkaToTPFSAvro| replace:: **Real-time Kafka to TPFS Avro:**
.. _RealtimeKafkaToTPFSAvro: RealtimeKafkaToTPFSAvro

- |RealtimeKafkaToTPFSAvro|_ This application fetches messages from Kafka in real time and writes to Time-PartitionedFileSets in Avro format.


.. |RealtimeTwitterToHBase| replace:: **Real-time Twitter to HBase:**
.. _RealtimeTwitterToHBase: RealtimeTwitterToHBase

- |RealtimeTwitterToHBase|_ This application reads Tweets from Twitter in real time and write to an HBase Table.


What You Will Need
==================

- `JDK 7 or 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__
- `CDAP SDK <http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/getting-started/standalone/index.html>`__


Let's Begin!
============
For these guides, we will use the CDAP CLI to create and manage Hydrator Applications. The CLI
commands assume that the ``cdap`` script is available on your PATH. If this is not
the case, please add it::

  $ export PATH=$PATH:<CDAP home>/bin
  
or, from within the <CDAP home> directory::

  $ export PATH=${PATH}:`pwd`/bin

If you haven't already started a standalone CDAP installation, start it with the command::

  $ cdap sdk start

Now navigate to the Hydrator Application that you want to create and you will find further
instructions on how to create that specific application:

- |CDAPTableToDBTable|_ This application exports the contents of a CDAP HBase Table to a Database Table in Batch.

- |DBTableToCDAPTable|_ This application exports the contents of a Database Table to a CDAP HBase table in Batch.

- |StreamToImpala|_ This application makes the events ingested in a CDAP Stream queryable through Impala.

- |RealtimeJMSToStream|_ This application reads messages from a JMS producer in real time and writes to a CDAP Stream.

- |RealtimeKafkaToTPFSAvro|_ This application fetches messages from Kafka in real time and writes to Time-PartitionedFileSets in Avro format.

- |RealtimeTwitterToHBase|_ This application reads Tweets from Twitter in real time and write to an HBase Table.
