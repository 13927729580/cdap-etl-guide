=====================================================
Creating ETL Applications using CDAP System Artifacts
=====================================================

Using the built-in ``cdap-etl-batch`` and ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifacts,
you can create ETL Pipelines (ETL Applications) with just a JSON configuration file. 
CDAP ships with a set of built-in Sources, Sinks and Transforms as described `here <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/cdap-apps/hydrator/index.html>`__
which can be used to create Batch ETL Applications and Real-time ETL Applications right out of the box.

Note: If you want to create your own Source and Sink, you can find more instructions on how to do that `here <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/cdap-apps/hydrator/custom.html>`__.

What You Will Create
====================

.. |DBTableToHBaseTable| replace:: **Batch Database Table to CDAP HBase Table:**
.. _DBTableToHBaseTable: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/DBTableToHBaseTable

- |DBTableToHBaseTable|_ In this Application, we will export the contents of a Database Table to a CDAP HBase table in Batch.


.. |HBaseTableToDBTable| replace:: **Batch CDAP HBase Table to Database Table:**
.. _HBaseTableToDBTable: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/HBaseTableToDBTable

- |HBaseTableToDBTable|_ This Application exports the contents of a CDAP HBase Table to a Database Table in Batch.


.. |StreamToImpala| replace:: **Batch CDAP Stream To Impala:**
.. _StreamToImpala: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/StreamToImpala

- |StreamToImpala|_ This Application makes the events ingested in a CDAP Stream queryable through Impala.


.. |Real-timeKafkaToHBase| replace:: **Real-time Kafka To HBase:**
.. _Real-timeKafkaToHBase: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/RealtimeKafkaToHBase

- |Real-timeKafkaToHBase|_ With this Application, we will fetch messages from Kafka in real time and write to an HBase Table.


.. |Real-timeTwitterToHBase| replace:: **Real-time Twitter To HBase:**
.. _Real-timeTwitterToHBase: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/RealtimeTwitterToHBase

- |Real-timeTwitterToHBase|_ In this Application, we will read Tweets from Twitter in real time and write to an HBase Table.

.. |RealtimeJMSToStream| replace:: **Real-time JMS To Stream:**
.. _RealtimeJMSToStream: https://github.com/cdap-guides/cdap-etl-guide/tree/develop/RealtimeJMSToStream

- |RealtimeJMSToStream|_ In this Application, we will read messages from a JMS producer in real time and write to a CDAP Stream.

What You Will Need
==================

- `JDK 7 or 8 <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`__
- `CDAP SDK <http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/getting-started/standalone/index.html>`__

Let's Begin!
============

For these guides, we will use the CDAP CLI to create and manage ETL Applications. The CLI commands assume that the ``cdap-cli.sh`` script is available on your PATH. 
If this is not the case, please add it::

  $ export PATH=$PATH:<CDAP home>/bin

If you haven't already started a standalone CDAP installation, start it with the command::

  $ cdap.sh start

Now navigate to the ETL Application that you want to create and you will find further instructions on how to create that specific ETL Application.
