Real-time Twitter to HBase Application Configuration
====================================================

Let's say we want to fetch Tweets from Twitter in real time and persist them in an HBase
Table. The ``cdap-etl-realtime`` system artifact can be used to create an Application that
reads from a real-time Source and persists it to a real-time Sink. In this example, we
will read messages from Twitter and use a TableSink to write the Tweets to HBase.

Configuration
=============
The file `config.json <config.json>`__ contains a sample Application configuration that
you can use to accomplish the above task.

You can create and start the Application by using the CDAP CLI (or you can use the Cask
Hydrator UI for a more visual approach).

**Notes:**

- You need to fill in the following configurations in a file such as the `config.json
  <config.json>`__ before creating the Application.
  
- If you want to import the ``config.json`` into the Cask Hydrator UI, you will need to
  modify it to include an ``artifact`` property describing the system artifact being used.
  You can create an initial application as described here using the CLI and then clone it
  in the UI to develop it further.

Source
------
We choose the Twitter Source and provide the OAuth credentials as properties to the Source. Since we 
want to persist the Tweets to HBase, we use a Table Sink. For the Table Sink, we set the table name 
to be ``tweetTable`` (which will be created if the Table doesn't exist already) and we set the row key to 
be the ``id`` field of the Record emitted by the Twitter Source.

For selecting the Source, we use the "source" property. The Twitter Source expects four properties 
(OAuth credentials for Twitter):

- ``AccessToken``
- ``AccessTokenSecret``
- ``ConsumerKey``
- ``ConsumerSecret``

Note: You need to fill in the OAuth credentials in ``config.json`` before creating the
Application. You can visit `Twitter <https://dev.twitter.com>`__ for more information on
how to obtain OAuth credentials for the Twitter Source.

Sink
----
Similarly, for selecting the Sink, we use the "sink" property. The Table Sink expects two properties:

- ``name``: Name of the Table Dataset.
- ``schema.row.field``: The field which is used as the row key in the Table.

Creating and Running
====================
Create an ETL Application named ``tweetApp`` (replace <version> with your CDAP version) using the CDAP CLI::

  cdap> create app tweetApp cdap-etl-realtime <version> system RealtimeTwitterToHBase/config.json
  Successfully created application

  cdap> start worker tweetApp.ETLWorker
  Successfully started worker 'ETLWorker' of application 'tweetApp' with stored runtime arguments '{}'


You can verify that the data is being written to the ``tweetTable`` dataset by executing a query against it::

  cdap> execute 'select * from dataset_tweetTable limit 5 '

  +================================================================================================================+
  Fetched 5 rows

You have now successfully created an Application that retrieves Tweet data from Twitter and writes to an HBase Table.


Stopping and Deleting
---------------------

You can stop and delete the Application using the CDAP CLI::

  cdap> stop worker tweetApp.ETLWorker
  Successfully stopped worker 'ETLWorker' of application 'tweetApp'

  cdap> delete app tweetApp
  Successfully deleted application 'tweetApp'
